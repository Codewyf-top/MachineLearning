Machine Learning =>supervised learning

pattern recongnition =>unsupervised learning

Machine Learning included:

I.Classification -> a discrete set of outcome

II.Regression -> real-valued outcome

    age estimation; 
    stock value prediction;
    temperature prediction;
    energy consumption prediction;

obatining lables is a arduous/trivial task

Solution Space S: all possible theta0 and theta1

This is called univariate linear regression

Two types of parameters for any ML models:

    Intrinsic parameters:I.efficiently learned bon training set II.large 
    Hyper-parameters:I.learn need generalisation error II.small III.no efficient serach possible
